## 📌 Overview
This repository contains an **executive-level sales and profitability analysis** focused on understanding **what drives profit, where losses occur, and why margin erosion happens**.  
The project combines **Excel and Tableau dashboards** to deliver both **operational visibility** and **strategic, executive insights**.

The analysis answers four key business questions:
- How is the business performing overall?
- Which products drive profit and which destroy value?
- Where are losses geographically concentrated?
- How do discounts impact profitability?

The final output is a **single-page executive dashboard** designed for decision-makers, with no filters or interactivity required.

## 🧠 Key Business Insights
- Profitability is **highly concentrated** in a small number of product sub-categories (Pareto effect).
- Several sub-categories generate **consistent losses**, eroding overall performance.
- Losses are **geographically concentrated** in specific states rather than spread evenly.
- Higher discount levels increase sales volume but **significantly reduce average profit**, making aggressive discounting unsustainable.
- Improving profitability is more about **selling smarter**, not selling more.
