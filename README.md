## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains an **executive-level sales and profitability analysis** focused on understanding **what drives profit, where losses occur, and why margin erosion happens**.  
The project combines **Excel and Tableau dashboards** to deliver both **operational visibility** and **strategic, executive insights**.

The analysis answers four key business questions:
- How is the business performing overall?
- Which products drive profit and which destroy value?
- Where are losses geographically concentrated?
- How do discounts impact profitability?

The final output is a **single-page executive dashboard** designed for decision-makers, with no filters or interactivity required.

## BI & Analytical Reporting (Tableau Dashboard)

The Tableau Sales & Customer Overview Dashboard provides interactive business intelligence reporting focused on understanding sales trends and customer behavior.

The dashboard delivers:

- **Sales Performance Monitoring** — Visualization of overall sales trends and performance across time and product categories.
- **Customer Overview Analysis** — Insights into customer distribution and contribution to sales performance.
- **Product & Regional Sales Breakdown** — Analysis of how sales vary across product categories.
- **Interactive Exploration** — Enables users to explore sales patterns and performance dynamically for deeper understanding.

This dashboard serves as a foundation for exploratory analysis, supporting deeper profitability and performance investigations conducted in the executive Excel dashboard.

## BI & Analytical Reporting (Excel Dashboard)

The Excel Executive Sales & Profitability Dashboard delivers business intelligence insights through structured analytical reporting designed for executive decision-making.

The dashboard provides:

- **Executive KPI Reporting** — Summary metrics including total sales, profit, profit margin, loss-making orders, discount levels, and shipping performance.
- **Product Profitability Analysis** — Identification of product sub-categories driving profit versus those generating losses.
- **Profit Concentration Analysis (Pareto 80/20)** — Demonstrates how a small group of products contributes the majority of total profit.
- **Regional Loss Analysis** — Highlights geographic locations where profitability is negatively impacted.
- **Discount Impact Analysis** — Shows how increasing discount levels affect average profitability.

These analytical views enable stakeholders to quickly understand performance drivers and take targeted actions to improve profitability.

## 🧠 Key Business Insights
- Profitability is **highly concentrated** in a small number of product sub-categories (Pareto effect).
- Several sub-categories generate **consistent losses**, eroding overall performance.
- Losses are **geographically concentrated** in specific states rather than spread evenly.
- Higher discount levels increase sales volume but **significantly reduce average profit**, making aggressive discounting unsustainable.
- Improving profitability is more about **selling smarter**, not selling more.
